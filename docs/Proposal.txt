  	My proposed project will be to develop a web application that allows you to manage photos. 
	A user will be able to upload and download their photos as well as organize and edit them.  
	There already exist tools that allow a user to store photos but the ability to edit them is lacking. 
	Putting an emphasis on editing functionality will help make this project more innovative than some other existing systems. 
	For example, Adding the ability to crop and rotate photos and change filters like sepia or gray scale.  
	The project will be written using the Ruby programming language.  The algorithms being used in this project are involved
	with creating many different filters as well as sorting the photos.  Creating filters, managing a database, and file 
	conversions are some of the new concepts that I will learn from this project.  In order to create a bigger toolkit for
	editing I will need to explore different editing techniques like filtering.  I will need to have a place to store and 
	manage all of the uploaded photos so utilizing a database is a something new.  Learning how to change the formatting of 
	pictures for downloading will be beneficial if a user wants to conserve space with a more compressed file type.  
	This project is a web based photo management and editing application.  This will allow users to store, organize, 
	download, and edit their own photos.
